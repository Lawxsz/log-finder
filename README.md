Welcome to **Combo Searcher Tool**, a tool designed to help you search through large combo lists in `.txt` format effortlessly. This program allows you to import multiple combo files, search for specific URLs, usernames, or passwords, and extract the data you need in a quick and efficient way!

## 🌟 Features
- **Multiple combo import**: Load several combo files at once to streamline your workflow.
- **Search by URL**: Find all associated passwords for a specific website.
- **Search by username**: Identify accounts connected to a particular user.
- **Search by password**: Retrieve all entries using a given password.
- **Fast C++ version**: For faster performance, try the C++ console version of the tool!

## 📜 How to Use
1. **Obtain a combo file**: Find a combo, such as a `500mb.txt` file from sources like Telegram.
2. **Import**: Upload the combo file into the program.
3. **Set your argument**: Search using one of the following:
   - A **URL** to locate passwords tied to a website.
   - A **username** to find data linked to a user.
   - A **password** to gather all instances using a certain password.

   🚀 You can even **import multiple combo.txt files** at the same time!

## ⚡️ Performance Recommendation
While the Python version is easy to use, it may be slower for large data sets. We highly recommend the **C++ version** if you need faster performance, as it handles large files more efficiently.

> **Python 3.10.6** is recommended for this project to ensure the best compatibility and performance.
